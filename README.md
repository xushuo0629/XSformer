ðŸ”” This is the code of a X-ray Build-Up Factor Calculating Method for Multilayer Shields

ðŸ”” We proposed a network based on [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

## Dataset
Te Monte Carlo method is uesd to generate dataset with different energy, different shield thickness, and different shield material combinations. 
Establishing concentric sphere model to improve simulation efficiency.

## Network architecture
use Transformer as backbone.
